# Charisma

Charisma provides a *superficiality framework* for Ruby objects. You can use it to:

* Provide a *curation strategy* for your class that defines which of its attributes are *superfically important.*
* Define *metadata* on these characteristics, such as measurements and units.
* Facilitate *appropriate presentation* of these characteristics (i.e., intelligent `#to_s`).
